# Finger-Count-Detection
This project implements a real-time computer visiom system that detects a human hand, segments it from the background, and counts the number of fingers being held up using a webcam feed.
The system demonstrates fundamental computer vision concepts such as background subtraction, contour detection, convex hulls, and geometric analysis.

Features:
. Real-time hand detectiom using a webcam
. Background modeling and subtration
. Hand segmentation using thresholding and contour extraction
. Finger counting using convext hull

Technologies Used:
. Python
. Open CV
. NumPy
