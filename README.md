# Finger-Count-Detection
📌 Summary

This project implements a real-time computer vision system that detects a human hand, segments it from the background, and counts the number of fingers being held up using a webcam feed.

The system demonstrates fundamental computer vision concepts such as background subtraction, contour detection, convex hulls, and geometric analysis.
